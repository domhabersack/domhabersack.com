The logo search site [instantlogosearch](https://instantlogosearch.com) was very popular a few years ago. More up to date and user friendly than [Brands of the World](https://www.brandsoftheworld.com), it made the job of finding high-quality icons easy. For a while, it was integral to my workflow.

Unfortunately, it stopped working a few years ago. I had to go back to manually going to each company’s site, hunting for SVG versions of their logos. While some made them easily accessible, many did not. To test my new tech stack, I wanted to build a site that replaced instantlogosearch in my own workflow.

Along the way, I had to adjust the idea a few times.

(I’ll add more on this soon. I’ll release this page as-is and extend it later this week.)
