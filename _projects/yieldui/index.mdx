As I’m building many projects in a row, I tend to use similar components across them. Since I rely on Tailwind CSS for my styling, they can easily be moved over. Still, the workflow of finding a component and transfering it in from another project isn’t ideal.

Since I’m also working in React, I started collecting some of my components in a reusable library. By importing this library in a new project, I have instant access to all my previously styled building blocks.

While the React library is still in a very rough shape, the HTML it returns is already shareable. Visitors can copy and paste the code into their own projects.

I’ll add more components as I need them for my projects. You can browse the growing collection over on [yieldui.com](https://yieldui.com).
