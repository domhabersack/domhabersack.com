I have not met anyone that never said “I don’t have time for that”. So many of us are “too busy” to do the things we really care about.

It’s something else for everybody. Some want to start doing sports again. Others want to read more books. Still others want to hang out with their friends more often. If those activities are important to us, why do we not give them more space in our lives?

Work and other responsibilities get in the way. Long commutes, mindless bingewatching, “cleaning up” by moving things back and forth between the same two locations. That’s no way to live, but we can fix it.

I am working on a course that will help you make more time for the things you love. It’ll be a few weeks before it’s done, and I need your help to cover what _you_ care about. If you can reply to this message with whatever comes to mind first on these two questions, I’ll have more to go on:

- What activities do you wish you had more time for?
- What things take up too much of your time right now?

Thanks so much for your help!

PS: Finally adding a “courses”-entry to the navigation on [my website](/) probably sounds silly to most. This mockup gets me excited like you wouldn’t believe:
