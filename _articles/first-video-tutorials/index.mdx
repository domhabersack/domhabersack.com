When I want to learn something new, I often start by looking for tutorials on YouTube. Whether it’s coding, cooking, or cleaning: it’s where I go first before falling back to regular websites.

I finally recorded and uploaded some of my own videos to YouTube. Instead of coming up with new topics, I repurposed some of the content I already have. If you’ve read this newsletter for a while, you’ll recognize the topics of those videos.

## Get more value from your git log

In this video, I walk you through how you can change what a git log looks like in your terminal step by step. We can customize it to show more helpful information in a way that is easier to parse.

<div className="mb-6">
  <YouTubeVideo id="zqx19b1lOhc" thumbnail={figures['zqx19b1lOhc']} title="Get more value from your git log" />
</div>

## Progressive enhancement in CSS with @supports

With `@supports`, we can start using new features before all browsers support them. We give a basic version to all browsers and enhance it in browsers that support those features. The video shows how this works with the new CSS rule `backdrop-filter`.

<div className="mb-12">
  <YouTubeVideo id="NjJPTNnpR1k" thumbnail={figures['Yzmj7-Wy95M']} title="Progressive Enhancement with @supports" />
</div>

If you check them out, let me know what you like or don’t like about them. I’ll start uploading more videos soon. Any pointers you have for me early on would save me a lot of trouble. If there’s anything you want me to talk about, reply to this email and I’ll make a video on it soon!
