**TL;DR:** I wrote an article on [creating a multi-author blog with Next.js](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/06/creating-multi-author-blog-nextjs/) that was published by Smashing Magazine.

Over the last few months, I have worked with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) a lot. After years of React, I’m getting a lot of value out of Next. It takes care of things like routing, server-side rendering, image optimization, and more. I don’t have to spend time on setting up these basic features by hand, which allows me to focus on each project’s business case.

When the folks over at [Smashing Magazine](https://smashingmagazine.com) tweeted they wanted [articles on Next.js](https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/1384785552629805057), I jumped on the opportunity. Since this was my first time writing for a site much larger than mine, I didn’t know what to expect. From the first contact to the eventual publication, the entire process was incredibly smooth.

Vitaly and Iris over at Smashing Magazine were super helpful along the entire project. Their experience working with many authors clearly comes through. We talked about a few potential topics and landed on a technique I use frequently.

Most of my projects ingest Markdown files from the filesystem. With no database involved, I often need a way to connect two pieces of information, like authors and posts or songs and playlists. The article covers how to set up foreign key relationships with flat files.

The team at Smashing first asked for a rough outline in which I described and structured the article. After they made a few suggestions, I fleshed out that basic structure. Having the outline in place made it easy to fill it in the rest. By the time I was done with my first draft, the article came in around 4000 words or so.

[Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io), Head of Developer Relations at Vercel, reviewed that first draft. Their suggestions were easy to work in, mostly suggesting I include more of Next’s features like `next/image` and `next/link`. Once I had dotted my i-s and crossed my t-s, Iris from Smashing told me they wanted to publish the article later that day. You can now read the article on [creating a multi-author blog with Next.js](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/06/creating-multi-author-blog-nextjs/) over on Smashing Magazine.

They usually pay authors for each article. As I had closed my sole proprietorship a few weeks earlier, I could no longer write invoices. We bounced a few ideas regarding alternative compensation and landed on a [book giveaway via Twitter](https://twitter.com/domhabersack/status/1410129412134248449?s=20) (my suggestion). They were so kind to allow me to give away three printed books from [their collection](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/). They even handled shipping, meaning I only had to pick three winners.

As I had also never done a giveaway before, I first researched how others do them. Some have very light entry conditions, counting every like of a tweet as an entry into the raffle. Others require a higher commitment, like retweets or even follows.  The followers people gain through those kinds of incentives are usually of a lower quality. Sure, having a larger number of followers is nice. At the same time, if those followers don’t care about your regular content, they are of little value. Instead of silent followers, you want people you can interact with.

A follow-requirement was out of the question for me. Retweets also felt too invasive, as I didn’t want to force people to inject my tweet into their profiles. To still ask for a higher commitment than a like, I had them reply to the giveaway tweet.

With Smashing offering many different books, I didn’t want to limit the selection myself. Winners could pick any of the books currently in print. I had them pick a book first to enter the giveaway. The tweet received 86 likes and 65 replies over about 24 hours.
