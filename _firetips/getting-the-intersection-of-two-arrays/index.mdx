To find which elements appear in both of two arrays, walk through every element in the first array and check if it exists in the second. With `Array.prototype.filter()` and `Array.prototype.includes()`, we can do that in a single line.

```js
const getIntersection = (first, second) => {
  return first.filter(element => second.includes(element))
}

getIntersection([6, 15, 19, 86, 4], [4, 19, 22, 92, 51, 37])
// ⇒ [19, 4]
```
