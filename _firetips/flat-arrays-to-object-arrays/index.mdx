If an array contains flat values, we can quickly turn those into objects by mapping over them. The name we give them in the call to `Array.prototype.map()` becomes the name of the objects’ property when we do it like this.

```js
// turn these strings into objects, where they become `name`-properties
['John', 'Paul', 'George', 'Ringo'].map(name => ({ name }))
// ⇒ [
//     { name: 'John'   },
//     { name: 'Paul'   },
//     { name: 'George' },
//     { name: 'Ringo'  }
//   ]
```
