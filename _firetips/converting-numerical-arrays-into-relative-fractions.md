We needed to convert an array of (positive) numbers into fractions of each other, with the largest number being 100 percent. This function turns all values into percentages between 0 and that largest value.

```js
const toPercentages = numbers => {
  const largestNumber = Math.max(...numbers)

  return numbers.map(number => `${number / largestNumber * 100}%`)
}

// Because 16 is the largest number in the array, it is treated as 100%. All
// other values are based on that: 8 is 50% of 16, 4 is 25%, and so on.
toPercentages([0, 8, 12, 6, 16, 3, 0])
// ⇒ ['0%', '50%', '75%', '37.5%', '100%', '18.75%', '0%']

// Percentages are based on the largest value, which is 40 in this example.
toPercentages([8, 15, 21, 5, 10, 40])
// ⇒ ['20%', '37.5%', '52.5%', '12.5%', '25%', '100%']
```
