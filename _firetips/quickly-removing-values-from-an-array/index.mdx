Setting the length of an array in JavaScript removes all values beyond that length. Setting the length to zero removes all values from it.

```js
// this array holds six values
const numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]

// by setting the length to 4, any value past the fourth element is removed
numbers.length = 4
console.log(numbers)  // ⇒ [4, 8, 15, 16]

// setting the length to 0 leads to the entire array being emptied
numbers.length = 0
console.log(numbers)  // ⇒ []
```
