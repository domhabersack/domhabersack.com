We use both _I_ and _me_ when talking about ourselves: _I_ when we are the subject of a sentence, _me_ when we are the object a verb refers to.

- _I_ am buying a car. → We are the subject doing something.
- The party was organized by _me_. → We are the object the verb refers to.

When we add another person to the mix, those rules seemingly go out the window for many people. When talking about us and another person, we generally name the other person first. We are listed after them, as either _and I_ or _and me_.

It is all too common for people to overuse (and misuse) _and I_. The choice between the options follows the same rule as before. Adding more people to the sentence does not change that.

- My wife and _I_ are buying a car. → We are still the subject.
- The party was organized by Matilda and _me_. → The verb still refers to us.

The quickest way to find out whether a sentence requires _and I_ or _and me_ is to remove the other people. You wouldn’t say “me am buying a car” or “the party was organized by I”. Once you know that, adding the other people back in won’t change your choice of _I_ or _me_.

If you only think about yourself, choosing between _and I_ or _and me_ becomes much easier. Sometimes being selfish pays off.

In some sentences, both _I_ or _me_ would work, but the choice drastically changes their meaning:

- He likes food more than I. → He likes food more than I like food.
- He likes food more than me. → He likes food more than he likes me.
