_Good_ is an adjective, meaning it modifies **people, places, and things**. You can eat good food and read good books. _Well_ is an adverb, so it modifies **action verbs**. Action verbs are those that describe actions, such as cooking or writing. You can sing well or, if you are good at eating food, eat food well.

There is another group of verbs called **linking verbs**. These do not describe actions, but connect other words together. The most common linking verb is _to be_. This group also includes words such as _to seem_, _to look_, or those describing senses such as _to feel_ or _to smell_.

Some verbs can be both action verbs and linking verbs. If you can replace a verb with a form of _to be_, it’s probably a linking verb:

- She smells nice. → She _is_ nice. (Still works, making “smells” a linking verb.)
- She smells flowers. → She _is_ flowers. (Does not work, making “smells” an action verb.)

We use adjectives after linking verbs. They refer to the noun before the verb, making them **predicate adjectives**. _Good_ is such a predicate adjective. _Well_ can be both an adverb and a predicate adjective.

- Joe ran well. (_Well_ is an adverb describing Joe’s action of running.)
- Joe is well. (_Well_ is a predicate adjective, describing how Joe is.)

Because both _good_ and _well_ are predicate adjectives, it is fine to reply “I am _good_” or “I am _well_” when someone asks you _how_ you are doing.

_Good_ can also be a noun, such as in “consumer goods” or “the greater good”. When someone asks you _what_ you are doing, you can still say “I am doing good”. This makes _good_ a noun, meaning that you are doing “good deeds”. Never let grammar nitpickers tell you you aren’t!
