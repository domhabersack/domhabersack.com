title: "What for a picture"
excerpt: "Not every word in a sentence needs to appear in its translation. Languages don’t map to each other one-to-one."

A friend scrolls through their phone, and you see something unusual. You can’t quite tell what it is and ask:

> “What is **that** for a picture‽”

If you speak German, you understand that the question asks what kind of picture something is:

> “Was ist **das** für ein Bild‽”

When comparing both versions, the pattern used in the translation becomes obvious. The sentence was translated word-for-word, which resulted in an awkward and incorrect translation.

This pattern makes foreign languages seem approachable. When translating many words at once seems hard, translating individual words seems easy. One word at a time, we could easily translate full sentences. We could translate entire books like this.

Unfortunately, languages are rarely this similar. Translations following this pattern will usually sound out of place.

“What for a” does not translate to “was für ein”. Use “what kind of” or drop the classifier when talking about details of something:

- What is that for a noise? → What kind of noise is that?
- What for a day is today? → What day is today?
- What for a great tip! → What a great tip!

“What for” is closer to “warum” or “wofür”. You use it when inquiring about the reason behind something:

- What are we having this meeting for?
- What did you punch me for?

You can capture a sentence’s essence without reproducing its grammar and wording. As long as the other person understands your intention, you don’t need to translate every single word.
