If you are making plans with others, you might want to let them know that you are excited about what you have planned. To announce your anticipation, you might say something like this:

> “Looking forward!”

Most sentences consist of three elements: a subject, a verb, and an object. In “Looking forward!”, the _subject_ is “I” and the _verb_ is “to look forward”. The full expression is “to look forward **to something**”, so the sentence is missing its _object_. You are leaving out what your sentence is about by not mentioning what you are looking forward **to**.

What you are expressing instead is a physical description of your eyes, explaining what direction they are looking at. It’s pretty close to announcing “I am looking straight ahead!” or “I am not cross-eyed!”

Imagine meeting a friend you have not seen in months. If you tell them “It is so good to see!” without adding an object to the sentence, they wouldn’t know you are happy to see _them_. While it generally _is_ good to see, that’s probably not what you want to express.

To complete the sentence of “looking forward”, you could use sentences like these:

- “I am looking forward to seeing you at the party this weekend!”
- “I am looking forward to hearing from you!”
- “I am looking forward to it!”

That last one only works if the meaning of “it” is obvious from the context you were talking about. In any case, the expression needs an object for it to form a complete sentence.
