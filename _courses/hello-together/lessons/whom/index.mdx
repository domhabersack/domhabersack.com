excerpt: "Why isn’t it “Whom let the dogs out”? The extra letter does not turn a regular “who” into a fancy version of itself."

The word “who” has a more sophisticated looking sibling, “whom”. While they are used in the same way and look almost identical, one cannot replace the other. _Whom_ is not the grown-up version of _who_, ready to be used when you want to speak English like an adult. They both refer to a specific set of answers that could be given to the questions they are used in.

If you can answer a question with **he**, **she**, or **they**, use _who_. If your options are **him**, **her**, or **them**, use _whom_. You can remember this rule by the “-m” in **him** and **them**: if the response could end in “-m”, use _who**m**_ instead of _who_.

You might have to rearrange your sentence a little to find which of the two applies:

- **Who/~~Whom~~** knows this? → **He** knows this. ~~Him knows this.~~
- **Who/~~Whom~~** owns this car? → **She** owns this car. ~~Her owns this car.~~

- **~~Who~~/Whom** can I ask? → ~~I can ask he.~~ I can ask **him**.
- **~~Who~~/Whom** does this car belong to? → ~~This car belongs to she.~~ This car belongs to **her**.

The grammatically correct response tells us which word to use when phrasing the question.

When in doubt, it is fair and safe to avoid _whom_. It is common for people to only use _who_ in practice, as _whom_ sounds very formal. Sticking to _who_ will usually not sound out of place, while using _whom_ incorrectly will. Overusing _whom_, particularly when using it incorrectly, can seem desperate to appear sophisticated.

In formal settings, using _whom_ according to the rule laid out here is appropriate. In informal settings, or when unsure if _whom_ applies, sticking to _who_ is perfectly acceptable.
