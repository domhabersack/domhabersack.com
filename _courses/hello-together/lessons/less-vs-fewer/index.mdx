title: "Less vs fewer"
excerpt: "Is it “less mistakes” or “fewer mistakes”? They both seem to say that something is not as much as it was before, but only one is grammatically correct."

_Less_ and _fewer_ are comparative adjectives that describe that something is decreasing. Depending on the subject of a sentence, only one of them is correct. Use _fewer_ with things you can count and _less_ with things you cannot count.

Let’s say you want to go on a diet. To do so, you could dial back on your consumption of candy bars. Because you could specify how many candy bars you mean, you want to eat _fewer_ candy bars. You could also be more generic and say you do not want to eat as much sugar. Because sugar is uncountable unless we talk about individual grains, you want to eat _less_ sugar.

- You can watch _fewer_ shows and _less_ television.
- You can drink _fewer_ cups of coffee or _less_ coffee.
- You can eat _fewer_ steaks and _less_ meat.

_Fewer_ answers the question of “exactly how many”. Use it when the noun can be paired with a number, such as “five shows”. You wouldn’t watch “three television”, making _less_ the correct choice in that case.

Unfortunately, this rule does not apply when talking about time, money, distance, or weight. These examples do not match the countable-uncountable-rule, but are still correct:

- My commute takes _less_ than 30 minutes.
- This meal costs _less_ than 15 dollars.
- They live _less_ than 500 meters from the office.
- My dog weighs _less_ than 10 kilograms.

If the exact value we refer to with these sentences could be a fraction (such as 25.5 minutes or 8.9 kilograms), we use _less_.

Some nouns, such as water or homework, are uncountable. With them, you will always use _less_.  If something is countable in integers only, use _fewer_. For example, this lesson will help you make _fewer_ mistakes.
