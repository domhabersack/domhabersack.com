“I can’t speak up in meetings because my English isn’t good enough.”

When interacting with others in a foreign language, being able to express your intentions clearly is important. If you don’t feel comfortable communicating in English, it can keep you from finally giving that presentation, participating in that meeting, or getting that job you always wanted.
